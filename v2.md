Based on:

Nilofer Merchant on the health consequences of sitting too much

 "how do you make incremental change in your life?  how do you
 incorporate a range of micro changes, in order to produce a
 macro-level output?  If you focus too much on the micro
 (which is the day-to-day, which you naturally focus on),
 you will ignore the macro & screw it up."

= Therefore: the focus of the app could be considered: a tool for ignoring the micro, and instead visualizing the macro.
= So, the idea here is to simplify the interface.  And something almost like, bubble bobble? or like Agar.io ?
The nice thing about Agar.io is how it scales out.  So relative differences would be cool to see.
Plus it kind of mirrors how doing that stuff actually works, right?  It relatively stays sort of the same size,
but other things in relation, get smaller.

-> one important difference between agar.io and this, is we want to retain the makeup of our macro-blob.
-> we want to be able to zoom in to the macro level.  There should be growing macro levels, right?
first that day.  Second that week.  third that month.  fourth that year.  fifth all time.
-> this is not a new thing, or at least not a new visualization problem.
=> could group by activity, could group by chronology.
=> let's go for the simplest schema possible too.  Who cares about redundancy.


=> how cool would it be if the interface was JUST you typing out your journal for the day, and the fucking APP was attempting
to auto-categorize things:
"Today I finally managed to do some > french readings <---.  I also -->cooked<-- an amazing meal"

Okay: So how does the bubble part work?

Zoom obviously trims outer data.

Okay, so:  First are nested chronologically, then are nested thematically.

Year -> Month -> Week -> Day: Day is most atomic for time.  Within day, micro elements are events in that day.
